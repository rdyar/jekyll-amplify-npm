  <h1>Jekyll with Amplify and NPM</h1>
  <p>Jekyll version {{jekyll.version}}, {{jekyll.environment}} environment.</p>
  {% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
  <b>This is the production environment!</b> We could have analytics code set to only run in production.
  {% endif %}
  <p>Just the basic files needed for a jekyll site to be built with NPM scripts and hosted on AWS Amplify.</p>
  <p>Link to <a href="/error/">error page</a>.</p>
  <p><button onClick="test()">Javascript test</button></p>
  <p>If you are seeing this in the browser and the H1 tag is a sort of teal color then things are working, sass has been processed. Try running `npm run deploy` and then look at the _site folder contents, the files should all be minified and the css should be prefixed, the first css rule should have webkit attributes added to it.</p>
  <p>Pull some images (3) to make sure they transfer - 2 are in sub folders.</p>
